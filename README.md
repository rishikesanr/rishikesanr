I am current learning to so much about Analytics as a student, and building a strong foundation. 

And I would love to colloborate on some of the projects I am working, especially EPL- Prediction Analytics, with the advancements happening around LLM, there is just so much potential to uncover here that haven't been tried earlier. 

You can contact me rravichandran@ucdavis.edu

Fun Fact: I like to work on things when it just gets complex :)
